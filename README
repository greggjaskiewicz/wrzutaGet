This is a java example, in public domain. I don't take any responsibility for it whatsoever.
So do not contact me about it.


Give it a file with list of wykop.pl urls, and it will either give you back list of the actual media urls
or if you give it another file name, it will save it there.

Simple , aye ?

This is a public domain code, I don't care about it.

Enojoy.
